By harnessing such complex systems, AI models driven by both knowledge and data can be developed to comprehensively analyze various aspects of battery aging, thereby supporting battery management and facilitating the estimation of SOH.

4. SoC calculation: SOH = Ct C0 (1) Among them, Ct is the current remaining capacity of the battery, and C0 is the rated capacity. Therefore, in the process of estimating the SOH of LIB, the following main issues need to be discussed and analyzed: 1. Obtaining an accurate and large number of LIB charge and discharge datasets; 2. Performing mathematical analysis to extract features that have a higher degree of correlation with SOH, and extracting a large amount of data related to features; 3. Data processing of battery characteristics to reduce fluctuations and noise; 4. Choosing a suitable machine learning model which takes into account accuracy and efficiency.
