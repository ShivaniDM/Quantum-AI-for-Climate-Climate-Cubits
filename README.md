### Project Title: Optimizing Battery Temperature for Electric Vehicles Using Quantum Annealing: Implications for Grid Load Management and Carbon Emission Reduction

### Overview
This project focuses on optimizing battery temperature management in lithium-ion (Li-On) batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) using quantum annealing. The primary goals are to maintain an optimal State of Charge (SoC) and improve the State of Health (SoH) of the batteries. This not only extends the battery life and improves EV performance but also facilitates smart charging strategies and contributes to reducing carbon emissions.

### Problem Statement
Battery temperature management is crucial as it impacts the lifespan and efficiency of EV batteries. Maintaining the SoC within optimal ranges is essential for efficient battery operation, and optimized battery performance can enable more effective smart charging strategies, thereby reducing grid load during peak times and aiding in carbon emission reduction.

### Methodology
The project methodology includes:
- **Data Preparation:** Converting NASA battery datasets from MATLAB to CSV format and processing data for SoC calculation.
- **Objective Function Formulation:** Using statistical methods to derive the objective function for the QUBO problem, targeting temperature minimization.
- **QUBO Formulation:** Developing the Q matrix for quantum annealing.
- **Quantum Annealing:** Implementing and testing the optimization problem on D-Waveâ€™s quantum annealer.

### Key Results and Impact
While still in progress, the project has the potential to:
1. **Extend Battery Life and Improve EV Performance:** Through optimized temperature management.
2. **Optimize Smart Charging Strategies:** Leading to reduced grid load during peak hours.
3. **Reduce Carbon Emissions:** By utilizing low-carbon energy sources more effectively during charging.

### Next Steps
- Compare Classical, AI, and Quantum Methods for optimizing SoH and SoC.
- Optimize constraints and penalties in the QUBO formulation for better results.
- Continue exploring emerging research in battery management and quantum optimization.
